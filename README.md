___
## Summary
This is a personal project written in Python and C++ that takes data from [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/) and stores them into a local SQL database on my device. I plan to use this project to deepen my understanding of C++ and Python. Thank you for check it out.

## Plans to implement
- Predictive model to predict outcomes of games
- Database for all major sports leagues including but not limited to: MLB, NBA, NFL, NCAAF, NCAAM, EPL, etc.
